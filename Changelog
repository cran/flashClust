	. Added the stats routine hcass2 to the package to avoid calling
	  undocumented internal function in the base distribution of R.

	. Added citation

2011-03-20: 1.01

	. Fixed incorrect clustering with methods "centroid" and "median".
	  Thanks to Chi Ming Yau and Daniel MÃ¼llner for pointing out the error
	  and suggesting a fix.
	. Speed now for the most part back up to the level experienced with
	  1.00-2 but still capable of working with larger data sets. 

2011-02-06: 1.00-3

	. Fixed overflow errors when the number of clustered objects is over ~45000. 
	  The code should now be able to cluster as many as 65000 objects,
	  given enough memory.

2010-07-19: 1.00-2

	. added a timing example in the help file

2010-02-19: 1.00  

	. added a wrapper called hclust so a fast version of hclust is used automatically after loading the
	  package

2009-11-13: 0.10-1

	. flashClust now checks that the input distance actually contains some data
